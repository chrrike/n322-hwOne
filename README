## Homework One

You must create an Ionic app that uses Angular and name it whatever describes your application.
You will then have a home page that has a list with whatever you want on the list. If you want your list items can be sliding items.
You will then navigate to the list detail page when you click on a list item.
On the detail page, you must have a back button that navigates back to the home page.
